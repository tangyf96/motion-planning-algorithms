## The next step of simulation
- produce more layouts with random P matrix, random obstacles, random number of goals. 
- change the name of the P matrix to match the background of the experiment
- Add the probability that human needs help. 
- First, one human at a single place for each experiment. The human will call for help according to the weight **w**.
